# Flutter Multi Platform Package Test

## ***The Plan* ‚Ñ¢**

1. ~~Clean up all existing branches of the app, condense into one main one, and push a release to `master` 0.2.3~~
2. Get the current app ‚Äúweb-safe‚Äù on a new branch `web` 
   - Migrate packages to be web and null safe
   - ~~Add null safety to the code base~~ - https://github.com/Spotlyt/spotlyt-app/pull/45
   - Have web and android and iOS versions working
3. Once we're happy with `web` working well on all platforms, merge into `development`, but not `master`, and save the new web and null safe ready `development`  branch to `stable-web` as an archive of the old web ready app.
4. Start the new radically `simple`, and `simple-dev` branch version of the app based off of the `development` branch from which we will pull in code from `stable-web`

At this point, we should have 6 branches:

- `master`: Release, Production. (Going to Users, ideally prefer channel `stable`, but will have to use `beta` later)
- `development`: The currently in development branch, used for testing. (Can be either in channel `beta` or `stable`)
- `stable`: Old stable app as an archive. (Can only be channel `stable`)
- `stable-web`: Old stable app that is web compatible as an archive. (Can only be channel `beta`)
- `simple`: New app where we will start to port code from `stable web`. (Going to builds for beta testing)
- `simple-dev`: The currently in development branch for the new simple app. (Can only be channel `beta`)

Dependency Tree: `master` <- `stable`, `development` <- `stable-web`, `simple` <- `simple-dev`

Once we are at the point, we can start trying to get users from the `simple` branch, and once we get users, we will push to `master` and remove the old build cycle, but to even get to that point, we have to finish Plan Step #2, we have to get web ready! I‚Äôm focused on getting us web ready, and of the packages we are using, a few don‚Äôt support web. I don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôre going to actually deal with this across the board, but a few ideas are:

1. Option A: Replace the package with an alternative that supports web.
2. Option B: Use conditional widgets or replacement imports - https://stackoverflow.com/a/60152950.
3. Option C: Remove the package altogether and make our own alternative or pull in the code and customize it.
4. Option D: Just wait for the package to support web.

I also started looking at null safety, since starting next year it'll be in beta and we can start writing our code to be null safe, so here are the packages, their support status and what I think we should do for each:

I think the better option would be to opt for Plan B, where I create a [SVG Widget that conditionally uses this package or a different one](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62560528) in Web.

If we want to keep it, we have to make it work in Flutter Web, which looks like it won't be a good implementation any time soon. If we want to replace it, I want to go with this Flutter compatible one called [Papercups](https://pub.dev/packages/papercups_flutter ). Or we don't have either. Either way, I need to stick in Segment for event tracking for stall points and admin panel data, and I want to use [Storytime](https://github.com/papercups-io/storytime) on Flutter Web. |

## Decide between Canvas or HTML: Features

Find all the pros and cons for each of the below, and figure out what works and what doesn't on HTML and Canvas, and fill out the `HTML? | Canvas?` column, so make sure to try everything on both; things to look out for:

## Chieh

- Figure out [ImagePicker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) and [ImageCropper](https://pub.dev/packages/image_cropper) - We need full replacements for this, or mish mash our own, or worst case we pull it all into our code and make it work
- Figure out [PermissionHandler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) - I think you pulled in this package
- Figure out [ReceiveSharingIntent](https://pub.dev/packages/receive_sharing_intent) - I don't think this exists on web at all, so all we have to do is make sure the feature works on android and ios and is ignored on web, probably a dynamic import
- Figure out [Share](https://pub.dev/packages/share) and [ShareExtend](https://pub.dev/packages/share_extend) - Figure out if there's a web alternative, if there is get it to work on all 3, if it doesn't make a dynamic import and ignore it on web
- Need to figure out [WebViewFlutter](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter) - Since web apps don't have web view, because, it is the web, I need to find a hack to show websites in the website. Going to be a problem, especially with CSR and CORS. Maybe have to solve with tabs using a dynamic import.
- See if it's possible to have Firebase packages that aren't web ready in the code base being used in non web platforms; maybe they'll need a dynamic import with noop web mirror functions
- Help test more things and help [Decide between Canvas or HTML](#decidebetweencanvasorhtml)
  - Test every `Feature` in the Features table
  - Test every `Package` in the Packages Table

## Oindril

- Need to figure out [FlutterStripePayment](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_stripe_payment) and [StripePayment](https://pub.dev/packages/stripe_payment) - There's no reliable stripe packages for mobile and web, so we need to make a full in house replacement. The good news is that the only two features the package provided was entering credit cards and verifying some specific card transactions, which will take a bit, but is possible, I think.
- Need to figure out [LaunchReview](https://pub.dev/packages/launch_review) - I found a million times better thing. In app review. Web doesn't have a replacement, so I just need to make the whole thing work with at minimum to send feedback to us for an NPS score in the Admin Panel, and if it's a positive score and not on web it opens the in app review prompt.
- Need to figure out [Intercom](https://pub.dev/packages/intercom_flutter) - it costs a lot, so need to decide with Andrew if we keep it or replace it with something else. If we want to keep it, we have to make it work in Flutter, if we want to replace it, I want to go with this Flutter compatible one called Papercups. Or we don't have either. Either way, I need to stick in Segment for event tracking for stall points and admin panel data.

Null Safety:

- https://dart.dev/null-safety/migration-guide#migration-tool
- Add `// @dart=2.9` to disable null checking in a file, but **<u>*DO NOT USE*</u>**
- **<u>*DO NOT USE `!` or `late`*</u>**
  - The `!` operator is a runtime null check in all modes, for all users. So, when migrating, ensure that you only add `!` where it‚Äôs an error for a `null` to flow to that location, even if the calling code has not migrated yet.
  - Runtime checks associated with the `late` keyword apply in all modes, for all users. Only mark a field `late` if you are sure it is always initialized before it is used.

# SIMPLIFY:

## MINIMIZE PLATFORM SPECIFIC CODE!!!!

## MINIMIZE PACKAGES!!!!

`flutter create --description "Flutter Multi Platform Package Test" --org "com.multiplatform.test" --project-name "flutter_multi_platform_package_test" -t app .`



# 

1. Writing to firebase
2. The actual value is just null
3. Something broke
   1. It can technically be null and was not accounted for in 2
   2. It can't be null, and something is wrong with the data

General Rule: Define something as null safe, and make exceptions for being nullable

Type - Null Safe | Type? - Nullable

Easier to go Type (Null Safe) => Type? (Nullable) than Type? (Nullable) => Type (Null Safe)

# DOCUMENT MODEL GOALS:

- Have two different implementations:
  - Main Class
    - Contains fields and their types, with null-safe fields which always should have a value
      - Needs to throw if DB gives value that doesn't match
    - Contains FirebaseDocumentModel with a reference and collection, which is ignored in toMap
    - Always come from firebase, a direct mapping of the data in the backend
  - Alternative Way to:
    - Have `default<ModelName>` values where the values can be null, following the main class
    - Have a way to write data where some values don't exist, following the main class
- Any helper methods on classes should be extentions so that it supports null safe values instead of 
  - Check sub class methods get extention benefits - num to int/double
- Minimize code needed per field
  - fromMap factory boilerplate
  - toMap factory boilerplate
  - toJson, toString, equals, and Dashcode generation
- Take advantage of Object Oriented Programming
  - `extends`
  - `implements`
  - `with`
